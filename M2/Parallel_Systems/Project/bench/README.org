#+TITLE: Study of Linux CFS threads-to-core mapping - linear_regression case
#+AUTHOR: Christopher FERREIRA

This repository contains everything necessary to run the experiments.

* Structure

 + benchmark: Contains the source code of the benchmark application used for the experiments
 + benchmark/linear_regression: So far, it only contains the application linear_regression
     (pthread test version from the Phoenix Map-Reduce implementation version 2.0 https://github.com/kozyraki/phoenix/)
     The folder benchmark/linear_regression.c also contains a fixed version `linear_regression-pthread-fixed.c` which fix the 
     false sharing issue discovered.
 + run.d: Boilerplate scripts to run the application (internally used by the run script)
 + tools/PinThreads: The tool used for pinning threads to core
 + Makefile: Run preparations for the experiments (compile benchmark/tools and download inputs)
 + run: Script which run the experiments
